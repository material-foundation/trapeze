import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// Before vite, we used wireit + tsc for building.  Because tsc checks all the
// types before generating JS, the delay between editing a file and seeing a
// change in-browser got to be too long.  vite short-circuits type checking,
// effectively stripping the types and presenting the result in the browser as
// quickly as possible.
//
// The config below provides vite with raw TypeScript for fast iteration cycles
// when running the dev server, but with tsc-checked JavaScript otherwise.
//
// This is my first try using vite.  We may later find that there's a better way
// to incorporate type-checking (maybe wireit + tsc isn't needed anymore).  For
// now, this gets us the speed of vite's dev cycles without changing how our
// packages are generated.
